The PBPK model for pitavastatin was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* single intravenous administration and single oral administrations (tablets).
* a dose range of 0.2 to 4 mg.

The model quantifies excretion via bile through BCRP transport, influx to liver via OATP1B1/1B3 and metabolism via unspecified UGT enzyme present in the liver.

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-pitavastatin-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-pitavastatin-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
