Pitavastatin  is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and indicated for hypercholesterolaemia and for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Pitavastatin is an orally delivered drug with a bioavailability of about 80%. Pitavastatin is mainly excreted
via the bile via uptake into the liver by OATP1Bs and efflux to bile via BCRP, renal excretion is negligible.  

This pitavastatin model is intended to be used as a victim drug in OATP1B1-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI).

This whole-body PBPK model of pitavastatin has been developed using published pharmacokinetic clinical data by Mori 2020 ([Mori 2020](#5-references)), Takehara 2018 ([Takehara 2018](#5-references)), Lou 2015 ([Lou 2015](#5-references)), Kimoto 2022 ([Kimoto 2022](#5-references)), Chen 2013 ([Chen 2013](#5-references)) and Prueksaritanont 2014 ([Prueksaritanont 2014](#5-references)). 
The clinical data includedboth intravenous and orally administration and a dose range of 0.2mg to 4 mg pitavastatin. 
The model has then been evaluated by simulating clinical studies with individuals of different SLO1B1 genotypes and comparing with respective observed data. 

The presented model includes the following features:

- metabolism by unspecified UGT enzym present in the liver,
- transport by OATP1B1/B3,
- transport by BCRP
- no renal clearance,
- oral absorption with dissolution rate assigned to the Lint80 function..
